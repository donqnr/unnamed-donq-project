- New Clusterfucker sprites w/ pickup sprite
- New Mini-Missile Launcher sprites
- Improved HUD probably
- More pickups (Armors, health items, food, powerups)
- Maps
- GLDEFS
- Credits
- Improve weapons
	- Plasma Cannon needs better, more fitting sprites
	- Machine Pistol probably needs better sprites, also a new firing sound instead of re-using the one from the pistol
	- Mini-Missile Launcher needs a more fitting sprite, maybe some balance tweaks
	- Mini-Missile Launcher might be a bit overpowered, rework it when it starts appearing in maps
- New Weapon(s)
	- Revolver as a new starting weapon in later episodes, pistol gets replaced with the Machine Pistol
- Special ammo tweaks
	- Phosphorous grenades are pretty weak, replace or rework them
	- Dragon's Breath and other fire weapons could set enemies on fire, dealing damage overtime. Not sure how to implement this yet though.
