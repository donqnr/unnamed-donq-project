A Doom II mod using GZDoom

Requires:

A recent version of GZDoom: https://zdoom.org/index

Doom II: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/  
Or  
Freedoom Phase 2: https://freedoom.github.io/  

The mod is intended to be run with Doom II, Freedoom will work but the visuals may clash with the mod's, as they're intended to used along with Doom II's.

To play, drag the project folder or the .pk3 file over the gzdoom.exe file

Still very much work-in-progress.
