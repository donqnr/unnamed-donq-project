A GZDoom project

Requires:

Latest version of GZDoom: https://zdoom.org/index

Doom II: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/
Or
Freedoom Phase 2: https://freedoom.github.io/

The mod is however designed to be played with Doom II, Freedoom works but a lot of the graphics will clash with the overall style
